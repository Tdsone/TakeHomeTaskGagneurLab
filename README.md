# Comparison of MMSplice pathogenicity scores of benign vs. pathogenic ClinVar variants

## Usage 
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary packages.
2. Extract the data using `tar -xjvf data.tar.gz`.
3. Run `python run_mmsplice.py` to make the predictions for the pathogenicity scores. 
4. Run the notebook to see a visual representation of the data.

Note: this is a short solution to the take-home-task for my application to the Gagneur Lab
